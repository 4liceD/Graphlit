To match point lights with bakery point lights enable physically based light falloff. For spot lights use the cone projection mask with 80% inner angle

Graphlit shaders use a physically based inverse square distance attenuation in the built-in pipeline.

Spot lights also use angle attenuation, instead of the default unity cookie texture.
