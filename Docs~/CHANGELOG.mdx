# Changelog

## [v2.0.0] - 2025-5-19

- Complete rewrite of core shader code
- Changes to the transparency mode require upgrading existing materials
  - Menu item `Tools -> Graphlit -> Upgrade Materials`
  - This upgrade is automatic when swapping to a graphlit shader
- Implemented softer shadow filtering for point and spot lights
- Implemented inverse square falloff for built-in point and spot ligths
  - This should make previewing baked lights with physically based falloff better
  - Enabled by default for now
- Fixed shadowmask and subtractive modes and optional bicubic shadowmask define
- Implemeted custom specular only lighting mode for bakery shadowmask directional lights
  - Set light color alpha to 0 to enable
- Fixed horizon occlusion
  - This prevents normal maps from pointing behind the geometry
- VRC Volumes
- Alpha to coverage
- Better URP support
- Realtime Lightmaps
- Lightmapped specular can now also fake specular from lightprobes
- Flip normal direction with cull face
- ZTest
- Cheaper specular for android
- Microshadows for directional light
- Mirror reflection mode
  - Samples a VRChat mirror texture instead of reflection probes
  - Normal maps currently dont affect it
- Keyword properties pass flags option
  - Pass flags skip adding kewords to unselected shader passes
  - This reduces shader variants and stops the graph from generating code, varings and attributes for the true branch, which also helps with optimizations
- New main shader `Graphlit/Lit`
  - This is mostly a direct replacement to the Lit shader recreated with the graph with some extra features
  - Separate roughness and metallic sliders when mask map is enabled with default value of 1
- Redesigned shader inspector
  - Linear texture warning
  - new [Folder(Name)] attribute replaces the old foldout attribute
  - Added [Indent(Value)], [ShowIf(_Property, Value)], [ExtraProperty(_Property)], [HelpBox] attributes

## [v1.0.0] - 2024-9-9

- Renamed to Graphlit
- Full custom lighting is now entierly possible in the unlit graph when enabling `Custom Lighting` - this creates all the passes and keywords required for lighting
- Creating a new Lit, Toon or Unlit graph now comes by default already setup with basic nodes
- Created a Toon sample with the new Unlit graph and the layered shadow node
- Created a Main light node with the light color, direction, shadow attenuation and distance attenuation which works both in unlit and lit graphs
- Fixed a bug with properties getting renamed when reordering them
- Refactored code for the lit graph
- Added B hotkey for split node
- Added G hotkey for get variable node
- Added all variable get nodes to the create nodes list
- Removed flat shading toggle in the lit graph
- Non linear lightprobe SH
- Use `_` to automatically create a valid reference name from the display name
- Added more samples
- Added a default toon
- Added a triplanar node
- Groups can now also be copied
- Copying nodes now works between graphs as well
- Non existing properties now get added automatically when copying nodes between graphs
- Added a Specular Higlights and Reflections toggle to the lit graph
- Implemented non important lights per pixel on the lit graph
- Added an icon
- Fixed loose edges in the graph view when changing nodes
- Add toggle button for previews on the node
- Increased height of ports on the master node
- Improved outline scale node
- Outline pass can now be toggled on the material
