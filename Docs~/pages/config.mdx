# Graphlit Project Config

Project config is applied to all Graphlit shaders in the project.

## Creating a Config

- MenuItem `Tools > Graphlit > Create Project Config`
- Created file will be selected in the project window
- Open and edit the file in a text editor
- Save and reload

This creates a copy of the default config. You can find the latest config here:
