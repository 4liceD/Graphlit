# Currently not implemented
- Groups are not saved
- Might lack some basic nodes
- Lacks validation (Same nodes shouldn't be allowed to connect to both shader stages, etc)
- Undo not fully implemented
- Default textures sometimes dont apply in the preview
- Not all inputs available in all transform spaces
- Custom varyings
