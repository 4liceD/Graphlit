## Environment Probe

This mode enables better reflection probe box projection, which are not bound to renderer bounds, using blend distance, similar to URP.
Because of certain unity limitation it requires box projection to be toggled OFF on the reflection probe( the toggle is flipped)
This enables sampling of the environment skybox probe, which is blended with remaning weight after samling the 2 most important reflection probes.
