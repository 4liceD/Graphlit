# Custom Function Nodes

Custom function nodes are entirely defined with code. They can either be inlined directly in the node, or imported from a file.

Inputs and outputs are automatically created by parsing the text. It is recommended to use `in` and `out` variables.
Any variable type can be used, even if it's not supported by the graph, to pass values between custom functions.
The last declared function in the file is used.

<Callout type="warning">
  Custom function parser is currently not very advanced. Some inputs and outputs
  might fail to parse, like using arrays etc. The function definition also has
  to be on one line.
</Callout>

To add custom function nodes to the graph search tree menu create an .hlsl and add a `GraphlitFunction` tag.

## Binding Inputs

You can bind inputs, for example `float2 UV` would automatically pass in the `uv0` texture coordinate to the function when input is not connected.

```hlsl filename="UVScaleCenter.hlsl" showLineNumbers
void UVScaleCenter(float2 UV, float Scale, out float2 Out)
{
    float s = 1-Scale;
    UV *= s;
    UV += 0.5 * Scale;
    Out = UV;
}
```

The list of binding names can be found in the [PortBinding](https://github.com/z3y/ShaderGraphZ/blob/master/Editor/Generation/PortBindings.cs) enum.
Some non-overridable bindings are not visible on the node.
